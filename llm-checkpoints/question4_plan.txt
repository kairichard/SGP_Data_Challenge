# Distance to Leader (DTL) Metric Implementation Requirements

## Overview
Calculate a Distance to Leader metric for each boat given position data and course XML.

## Data Requirements
1. Input Data:
   - Boat position timeseries (Lat/Lon) for all boats
   - Race course XML defining:
     * Mark positions
     * Gate locations
     * Course boundaries
     * Leg definitions
   - Synchronized timestamps across all boats

## Core Components

### 1. Race Progress Tracking
- Calculate percentage completion along current leg
- Identify active leg for each boat
- Handle mark roundings and leg transitions
- Account for upwind/downwind/reaching legs

### 2. Distance Calculations
- Direct distance to leader
- Distance along race course
- Account for:
  * Different legs
  * Course boundaries
  * Tactical considerations
  * Mark rounding zones

### 3. Leader Identification
- Determine current leader at each timestamp
- Handle boats on different legs
- Consider course progress not just physical position
- Validate against known race results

## Implementation Steps

1. Data Processing
   - Parse XML course data
   - Load all boat position data
   - Synchronize timestamps
   - Clean/filter noisy data

2. Course Representation
   - Define legs and gates
   - Create waypoints/checkpoints
   - Calculate optimal routes between marks
   - Define mark rounding zones

3. Progress Calculator
   - Project boat positions onto course legs
   - Calculate % progress on each leg
   - Handle transitions between legs
   - Validate progress calculations

4. DTL Calculator
   - Identify leader at each timestamp
   - Calculate distance behind leader
   - Account for different legs/tactics
   - Generate continuous DTL metric

5. Visualization/Validation
   - Plot DTL over time
   - Validate at mark roundings
   - Compare with race results
   - Performance testing

## Key Challenges
- Handling boats on different legs
- Accounting for course boundaries
- Dealing with missing/noisy data
- Validating distance calculations
- Performance optimization for real-time use
- Handling special cases (penalties, retirements)

## Success Criteria
- Accurate leader identification
- Consistent DTL measurements
- Handle all course configurations
- Real-time capable
- Validated against known race outcomes
